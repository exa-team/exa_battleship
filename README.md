# EXA Battleship

This is a simple project to learn TypeScript, ReactJS and SPA in a funny way.

## Project Structure
This is a single repo to make the process easier as possible so we've divided the server and client side in two root folders: `server` and `web`.
Each folder has its own structure, dependencies and can run separately.
